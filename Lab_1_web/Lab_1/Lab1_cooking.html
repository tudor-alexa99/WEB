                    Food photography has been around for quite a while, but it requires just a bit more than you could think of.. Here are some tips for you:

                    Tip no.1: Set the scene!
                </h3>
                <p align="middle">
                    In order to capture accurate and appealing photographs of food, you should try and use natural light when possible.
                    Artificial lighting can sometimes distort the true colors of the food.
                    When harnessed properly, natural light will highlight all the subtleties in texture and color tone.
                    <br>
                    To find the best natural light, move freely through your studio or space, taking a sample plate and camera with you to set up a test shot for lighting. Skylights are a great natural light source, just be sure to adjust the position of your scene so that the light falls on it.
                    <br>
                    If the light is being tricky or falling in an uneven way, a suitable alternative is to place your scene within a lightbox.

                    Tip no.2 : Work on your styling!
                </h3>
                <p align="middle" >
                    Collaborate. A good food photographer either collaborates with a team of other creatives or takes on the role of art director and stylist (and sometimes recipe creator, too!). Either way, there are a few food photography tips to follow to make the images of your food look good.
                    Think about complementary colors. When coming up with a concept and preparing for food styling, factor in the colors of the food and the complexity of the dish. There are infinite background options, ranging from a single, bold color to an entire table setting or kitchen scene.
                    Experiment with different backgrounds. Think tabletops, floors, window sills, and poster boards. Which background you choose depends on your personal style, point of view as a photographer, and creative expression of the food. Experiment with composition, and familiarize yourself with the Rule of Thirds
